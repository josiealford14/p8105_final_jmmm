### Drug Prices Affect US All (or some other corny intro)

### Informative Graphic (imbed plottly that gives overview to project)

In 2016, 1 in 5 Americans reported taking four or more prescription drugs (“Public Opinion on Prescription…”, 2016). Also, high drug prices have become an increasing concern in the United States (Hancock, 2016 ; "Why Prescription Drugs...”, 2017). This project aims at  exploring some of the factors associated with US prescription drug prices including  disease research funding, drug need (prevalence), sales, and advertising. Additionally, we seek to understand the types of drugs that receive patents/exclusivity.
